            More Bob Ross Quotes:   We'll make some happy little bushes here. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Just make little strokes like that. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Just beat the devil out of it. See there how easy that is. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Let's have a happy little tree in here. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. You can create anything that makes you happy. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.
